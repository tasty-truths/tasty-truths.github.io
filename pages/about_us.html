        Tasty Truths is all about helping you find that perfect recipe hassle
        free. Our team consists of a group of hard working students from Drexel
        University, who were tired of trying to find recipes that were blocked
        behind paywalls or hundreds of different ads and wanted to make a
        change.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We designed Tasty Truths for a easy and interactive experience for our
        users. From easy to navigate menus to the ability to rate and leave a
        review, Tasty Truths has it all. On Tasty Truths, Users have the ability
        to express their creative side with recipes they have created or
        changed. People can than interact with these recipes to give feedback
        and suggestions or just give complements to the chef for their amazing
        creations.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If users are looking for more of a social involvement, Tasty Truths can
        help also. Our blog pages allows users to share their experiences in the
        kitchen for other users to see. You can ask for recommendations or for
        help if you are stuck and don't know why something turned out the way it
        did. Tasty Truths also has a contact page which can help you reach out
        to different chefs about questions or partnering up on a recipe.

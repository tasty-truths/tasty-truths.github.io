# Tasty Truths

A recipe-sharing community built by students, for students — where good food meets real people.

What is Tasty Truths?

Tasty Truths is an open, student-friendly recipe platform with a social twist. It’s a place to discover, share, and discuss authentic recipes from around the world — without the ads, paywalls, or 10-page backstories.

Whether you’re a first-time cook or a seasoned kitchen experimenter, this project aims to bring together a global community that values good food, honest sharing, and creative flavor.

Core Idea
As a group we wanted to build a place that is welcoming for all, that includes people new to cooking, amateurs, and even the professionals. We want to create the google of cookbooks online that everyone can view, share, and explore.

Most recipe websites are either:

Hidden behind paywalls

Overrun with pop-ups and ads

Or full of filler before you ever get to the ingredients

Tasty Truths fixes that.

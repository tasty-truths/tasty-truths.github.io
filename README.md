A recipe-sharing community built by students, for students — where good food meets real people.

What is Tasty Truths?

Tasty Truths is an open, student-friendly recipe platform with a social twist. It’s a place to discover, share, and discuss authentic recipes from around the world — without the ads, paywalls, or 10-page backstories.

Whether you’re a first-time cook or a seasoned kitchen experimenter, this project aims to bring together a global community that values good food, honest sharing, and creative flavor.

Core Idea

Most recipe websites are either:

Hidden behind paywalls

Overrun with pop-ups and ads

Or full of filler before you ever get to the ingredients

Tasty Truths fixes that.
Our goal is simple: real recipes, real people, zero fluff.

Features (Planned & In Progress)

User-posted recipes — anyone can share their favorites

Social features — likes, comments, follows, and reposts

Images & media uploads — show off your dish

Cultural variety — highlight recipes from around the world

Student focus — quick, affordable, and honest food

Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Python

Database: SQLite, JSON, YAML

Will likely expand into phone app tech as well

Version Control: GitLab

Project Philosophy

Food is universal — learning should be too.
Tasty Truths is about sharing knowledge and culture through recipes, connecting people one meal at a time.
